Piece of my soul
I preach what I know
I'm counting down my days
Just want to let it go
And seek what I find
A piece of the mind
And rotting where I stay, where I lay, ever
Drama island totally
Rocking out a boulder piece
Roll the green, coat of lean
Uzi vert, shoulder lean
Loading screen, toke a fiend
Feeling good, so pristine
Ain't no BITCH, no GOD, no HOE, no MUHTHAFUCKA over ME

Pull up on a bit, no tundra
Hot in this hoe like summer
Ay
They don't really care till your 6 feet fuckin' under
Yo
Pay no bit no minding
Getting right behind it
Ay
MAGNUS X, the MAGNUS best, the rest know I'm a tyrant
Uh

Pull up on a bit, no tundra
Hot in this hoe like summer
Ay
They don't really care till your 6 feet fuckin' under
Yo
Pay no bit no minding
Getting right behind it
Ay
MAGNUS X, the MAGNUS best, the rest know I'm a tyrant

I am glow art
Sour bold cold tart
Old fart
Smokin' on that dank wood
Hoping that I go far
Oh lord
Choke whores
I am gone, so far
Shell up on the road hoe
Skrrting in my go-kart
Calm to the down on the dope
Bound to the ground I'm a boat
Hmm
Pee to the Pi to the Pay
Fee to the Fi to the Fo
FUM
Ride and I tide with the wave
Peek and I shine with the blame
Uh
Grind and I wind, and I rhyme with a dime and I'm climbing and I'm finding a way
I be rowing down and going down, Detroitin' like a piston
Lemon squeeze, oh lemon fiend, I'm crossing like a christian
Flipped 'em
Tempt 'em
Baby go and list-en
M-A-G-N-U- to the -S
I'm bumpin in yo sys-tem

Pull up on a bit, no tundra
Hot in this hoe like summer
Ay
They don't really care till your 6 feet fuckin' under
Yo
Pay no bit no minding
Getting right behind it
Ay
MAGNUS X, the MAGNUS best, the rest know I'm a tyrant
Uh

Pull up on a bit, no tundra
Hot in this hoe like summer
Ay
They don't really care till your 6 feet fuckin' under
Yo
Pay no bit no minding
Getting right behind it
Ay
MAGNUS X, the MAGNUS best, the rest know I'm a tyrant

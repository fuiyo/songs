You said at the party that I was too drunk
I told you I liked you, you said, "Sober up"
But why would I lie? It's so clear I'm in love
With you

A tense conversation, you like someone else
I say, "If I waited, could that maybe help?"
You told me that patience won't change how you felt
For me

So I'll stop being pretentious and loathing our friendship
You taught me a lesson, that love isn't precious
It's not like the novels, no Pride and Prejudice at all

So I'll just take a footnote in your life
And you could take my body
Every line I would write for you
But a footnote will do
A footnote will do

You ate at a restaurant, the host said we're cute
They think we're a couple, they bought us some booze
We shared the Moscato and laughed 'cause it's true
To me (to me)

Oh, and I'd be embarrassed if I weren't so pleased
That everyone else sees what you never see
We're perfect together, but I'll never be
The one

So I'll stop being pretentious and loathing our friendship
You taught me a lesson, that feelings are reckless
It's just like the novels, side characters end up alone

So I'll just take a footnote in your life
And you could take my body
Every line I would write for you
But a footnote will do
A footnote will do

A footnote will do (please, don't forget me)
(Forget me, please, don't forget me)
(Forget me, please, don't forget me) a footnote will do
(Forget me, please, don't forget me)

a footnote will do
A footnote will do
(Forget) a footnote will do
A footnote will do

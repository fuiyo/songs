Hello! Hello
So, I wanted to try and do something special
For someone very special to me
And so this is my attempt at doing that
Uh, yeah, here we go

Even when we're miles apart
I have your voice but feel no touch
You are so close to my heart
But we're far from flesh and blood
See, in a world so full of dissonance, our harmony's a flood
Inside my heart, I don't need cards
Or flying doves to feel our magic

See, your smile makes me smile, no that's cringe
Your laugh makes me laugh, that's even worse
If my journey on this path could ever lead to losing you
I know which path is not my path
You're a blessing from the skies
You're the thief that stole my mind
You're the reason why I think of you all the time

You're the little tiny bug that's found its way inside my ear
And now I can't think a thought without wishing you were here
And I know you don't care, I know that no one even asked
But you're who motivates me when I'm sad
You're the high school crush that I knew that I always wanted
But thought that I'd never have
Always missing my other half; that's you

And if I had a shiny nickel
For every time I missed you
I'd use them to buy the moon
Then sell the moon to North Korea
Then use all their fancy missiles
To blow craters in that moon
Until it spelled out our initials

Okay wait, that's absurd
Sorry, I'm bad with words
Let me start over
I guess what I'm trying to say
Aah, I'm messing this up, I've thought about this for days
I just haven't found the guts
To tell you truly I'm in

Look!, I'm not used to spending my time
Floating up on cloud nine
With you up in my mind
I used to spend my summers there
It turned to every weekend
Now I find myself among the clouds

When I should be home sleeping
That's your fault
That's right, I blame you
I blame you for all my birthday wishes that came true
Ever since we started dating, I am not the same dude
I've changed for the better
I blame you for that too

I really think we got this
I won't talk to you how they talked
I'd hike a million miles, cause a thousand is a cakewalk
So give it to me straight doc
I think it's meant to be
And you would think so too
If you knew what you meant to me awwn!

You know, I could ramble on for hours
But the words would never match up perfectly
To show the power that you hold
I thought that Midas was a king

So, how come ever since you've touched my heart
Everything has to turn to gold
You could still warm my heart if I lived up in the Arctic
And everything I felt was freezing cold
My dream is growing old, with you

But this letter ain't on paper because mailing stuff is hard
So you'll just have to imagine hugs and kisses on the card
But it's no longer "yours truly" that I'm writing at the end
It's "love, Nate XO, Until we meet again"
PS

You're perfect cause you always skip the BS
I really hope you smile when you see this
Write me back soon
I love you

Loving you was easy
Loving you was wild, unpredictable
Loving you was awful
But somewhere in the end it was beautiful
I can't say no when you get close
But I lose myself when I'm alone
In my room, missing you, got the TV loud
Just to fill it with noise when you're not around
You're out of my hands, I can't let go tonight

You're out of my hands, I'm out of my head
Try to be cool, but you know me the best
Ready to blow like I'm dynamite
But I can't let go if I see you tonight
If I see you tonight
If I see you to-
If I see you tonight
If I see you tonight

Hating you is harder
Harder than I'll ever let you know
Hating you is awful
'Cause I still care about you more than most
I can't say no when you get close
I lose myself when I'm alone
In my bed, missing you, put on all the lights
'Cause I'm scared of the dark when you're not around

'Cause you're out of my hands, I'm out of my head
Try to be cool, but you know me the best
Ready to blow like I'm dynamite
But I can't let go if I see you tonight
If I see you tonight
If I see you to-
If I see you tonight
If I see you tonight

Heard about you from our friends
Said you're looking good again
Do you ask them how I've been?
Heard you're working all the time
Got somebody on the side
Now you're slipping out of my

You're out of my hands, I'm out of my head
Try to be cool, but you know me the best
Ready to blow like I'm dynamite
But I can't let go

'Cause you're out of my hands, I'm out of my head
Try to be cool, but you know me the best
Ready to blow like I'm dynamite
But I can't let go if I see you to-
If I see you tonight
If I see you to-
If I see you tonight
If I see you tonight

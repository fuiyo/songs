I’ll get used to it, like catching a cold again
The ash gray light pushes through and endlessly passes by
But still

I must get through it
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Just need a moment
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Cuz it’ll pass, already

In the gray sky, there is a brighter light
Behind the dark clouds, there is a dazzling light
You shine like the stars
You light up my heart
At the end of today’s hardships
Brightly shine on me

Dadada Dadada Dum
Dadada Dadada Dum

Snap out of it, get up and brush it off
Pain is just a passing storm to me

I must get through it all
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Just need a moment
Cuz it’ll pass, it’ll pass
Cuz it’ll pass, already

In the gray sky, there is a brighter light
Behind the dark clouds, there is a dazzling light

You shine like the stars
You light up my heart
At the end of today’s hardships
Brightly shine on me

This isn’t the end
Better days will come
At the end of that day
You’ll shine on me like this

The sun is behind the clouds that cover the light
Without change, you shine on me forever
The quiet air, the warm wind
They’re all there, always in the same place

In the gray sky, there is a brighter light
Behind the dark clouds, there is a dazzling light

You shine like the stars
You light up my heart
At the end of today’s hardships
Brightly shine on me

Brightly shine on me

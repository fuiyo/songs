There's a million different reasons why I love you
And I'm sure that I could find a million more
There's not a single thing that I would change about you
You're picture perfect just the way you are
So show me every mark and every scar

'Cause I want you
And all your flaws
If you're looking for perfection
Take a look in your reflection
'Cause I got mine
But I want yours
When you feel like you ain't beautiful
Just remember, I'm in love with all your flaws

I know sometimes you feel like you are worthless
But I wish that you could see you through my eyes
You're amazing in your heart out to the surface
Don't cover up the pain you feel inside
'Cause you can tell me anything I promise, I, oh

I want you
And all your flaws
If you're looking for perfection
Take a look in your reflection
'Cause I got mine
But I want yours
And if you feel like you ain't beautiful
Just remember, I'm in love with all your flaws

You've been hiding things that I just really love about you
So promise me you'll be yourself and no one else because

I want you
And all your flaws
If you're looking for perfection
Take a look in your reflection
'Cause I got mine
But I want yours
If you feel like you ain't beautiful
Just remember, I'm in love with all your flaws

I want you
And all your flaws
I want you
And all your flaws

Do you remember when we used to be so carefree?
Driving back early A.M., got nowhere to go
Didn't wanna go home

Didn't really care, we're not afraid of the dark
No one ever told us life would get so hard

Growing up sucks, at least I got you
Growing up sucks, I know we'll get through
We're not in a rush, we're not gonna get fooled
Growing up sucks, but I know I'm with you

It was all so simple
Didn't have to care about other people
Just you and me, where do you wanna be?
Pedal to the metal, set ourselves free

Didn't really care, we're not afraid of the dark
No one ever told us life would get so hard

Growing up sucks, at least I got you (at least I got you)
Growing up sucks, I know we'll get through (know we'll get through)
We're not in a rush, we're not gonna get fooled
(Not gonna get fooled, never gonna get fooled)
Growing up sucks, but I know I'm with you (know I'm with you)

It's gonna be a bumpy ride, so hold on
No matter what happens, know that you're golden
It's time to go now, take my hand (take my hand)
Don't need to draw lines in the sand (in the sand)
We'll just do the best we can

Growing up sucks, at least I got you
(At least I got you, at least I got you)
Growing up sucks, I know we'll get through (through)
We're not in a rush we're not gonna get fooled
(We're never gonna get fooled)
Growing up sucks but I know I'm with you (you)

Dressed up all night
There's no one to impress
Standing in line
Still I smell like cigarettes
I don't know why my
Friends are so obsessed
With staying up 'til we're sober
Wasting money on regrets

I lost my jacket, about
To lose my mind
'Cause it's 5am and
I got work at 9
I'm all alone heading
For the exit signs
From the minute that
I saw you, I started thinking twice

There's something 'bout ya
You steal the room
I can't believe I never
Seen nobody, nobody like you
I'm freakin' out
Just tryna play it cool
I can't believe
I never seen nobody, nobody like you

Nobody like
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody, nobody like
Nobody, no, nobody like you
(No, no, nobody, nobody like you)
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody, nobody like
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody like

Fuck it, I'll stay 'til
I'm the last one left
For one chance to
Say that you're different
Than the rest
We're face to face, tryna
Get it off my chest, yeah
The lights are going
On here, wanna come
To mine instead?

There's something 'bout ya
You steal the room
I can't believe I never
Seen nobody, nobody like you
I'm freakin' out
Just tryna play it cool
I can't believe
I never seen nobody
Nobody like you

Nobody like
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody, nobody like
Nobody, no, nobody like you
(No, no, nobody, nobody like you)
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody, nobody like
Nobody, no, nobody like you
No, no, nobody like

There's something 'bout ya

I can't believe I never seen
Nobody, nobody like you
I'm freakin' out, tryna play it cool
I can't believe I never
Seen nobody, nobody like you

Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
Nobody, nobody like you
I don't know nobody like you

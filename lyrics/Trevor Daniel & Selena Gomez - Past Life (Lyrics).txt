I'm trying to be honest with my happiness
Don't know why I'm bad at this, uh
And I don't want to sit all in my sadness
I know it's a habit of mine
Perfect, perfect timing
I start but I don't know how to end
Don't re, don't remind me
I ruined it before it began, oh

Last night was the last night of my past life
Got me here like you can never figure me out
Last night was the last time, was the last time
I'll never let you figure me out
Sitting here, talking to myself
Thinking how I used to use you
Only thing I'm used to
Last night was the last night of my past life, whoa

Gave me what I wanted when I needed it
Honestly, I mean it
And if I could convince myself to feel it
You know I would feel it, I would
Perfect, perfect timing
I start but I don't know how to end
Don't re, don't remind me
I ruined it before it began, whoa

Last night was the last night of my past life
Got me here like you can never figure me out
Last night was the last time, was the last time
I'll never let you figure me out
Sitting here, talking to myself
Thinking how I used to use you
Only thing I'm used to
Last night was the last night of my past life, whoa

Oh, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Last night was the last night of my past life
Got me here like you can never figure me out
Last night was the last time, was the last time
I'll never let you figure me out
Sitting here, talking to myself
Thinking how I used to use you
Only thing I'm used to
Last night was the last night of my past life, whoa

Oh, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Where we've been, what we know
Will never go away
Will never go away

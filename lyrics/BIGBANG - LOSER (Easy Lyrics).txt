G-G-G-G-therz
No regrets, I roll in fresh like the Prince of Bel-Air
Finna make a big bang 'cause I am in the Del, yeah
Still rock the jaguar tooth and the black Yankee hat
When it’s time for action, I’m a rap maniac
'Cause on the mic, I’m more concentrated than Cuban coffee though
I’m firing shots right under you like a sub that’s shooting torpedoes
When I spit, I make it raw, with the limitations off
I’m monstrous like Godzilla, you couldn’t rub a double bass to imitate this roar
Huh, don’t fuck with the true passion type
When behind the wheel’s the only time you have a drive
So stay out my lane, there ain’t no EZ pass
Faster by the minute, I’m passing by the limit, but ain’t no way you’ll see me crash
I’ll treat y’all like bad drivers on the GSP or Route 35
Finna cut you off when I exit like the Jersey slide
'Cause I’m shining with the crown though, ain’t just from my pearly whites
Rye G-therz, I’m the bread maker, let me show you how it’s surely like
Don’t care ‘bout what you’re doing, I’m feeling like a boss
Can’t stop the way I’m moving, I got the want for more
I put the flavor to it, 'cause bitch I got the sauce
I’m hotter but cooler, popular loser, that’s how shit go dawg
Don’t care ‘bout what you’re doing, I’m feeling like a boss
Can’t stop the way I’m moving, I got the want for more
I put the flavor to it, 'cause bitch I got the sauce
I’m hotter but cooler, popular loser, that’s how shit go dawg
Back in the Del, they thought I’d be stacking these L’s
But I go in so fucking hard that you’ll get your girl a chastity belt
You’ve been a bitch from the start, me, I’m sick in this art
I know the ins and outs, I take these beats and pick them apart (Damn)
You’ll feel impact when I blast through your speakers
I’m on my Nas shit, I’ll send you back to the ether
When I deliver throwing jabs, you might miss it though, in fact
Some punches go over your head 'cause you’re as literal as Drax
I’m like a chupacabra 'cause I’m hunting for the goats
I’m eager, but I’m patient, so I’m coming for them slow
I shuffle with flows like the cards in deck
What did y’all expect, that I’m some joker like I’m Arthur Fleck
I’m the rap Jersey Devil, but ain’t finna ride with Three 6
It’s a fatal mistake though, if you try with me, bitch
'Cause even agnostics are finna cry for Jesus
I’m the T-H-E-R-Z, a different type of G shit
Don’t care ‘bout what you’re doing, I’m feeling like a boss
Can’t stop the way I’m moving, I got the want for more
I put the flavor to it, 'cause bitch I got the sauce
I’m hotter but cooler, popular loser, that’s how shit go dawg
Don’t care ‘bout what you’re doing, I’m feeling like a boss
Can’t stop the way I’m moving, I got the want for more
I put the flavor to it, 'cause bitch I got the sauce
I’m hotter but cooler, popular loser, that’s how shit go dawg
It’s Therz bruh, I’m more self-aware than Kanye
So bird up, it’s time for ranch like Eric Andre
You can say I’ve gone shady, it’s no surprised if called crazy
I’m just a messenger giving jazz like Art Blakey
Put my record in rotation, now it’s in the fifth dimension
But don’t take my path if you follow misdirections
When I’m jamming out, they think I’m deaf in the ear
But really bullshit’s the only thing I never could hear
Name anyone else in the game that happens to do shit like this
Bitch I got Big K.R.I.T.’s respect that I’m a rapper-producer hybrid
This is the only warning that I’m starting to speed again
'Cause afterwards, all that you’ll see is the mark of a cheetah print
I told you motherfuckers of what I do
I’ve never been a motherfucking punk like you
I’m a man of my word, better take in account
That Imma go off with my tongue like pew
Though I spit fast, I keep it lyrically dope
Wanna know where I get the quicker speed flow
Part of the reason is the mix in me though
I’m a fucking Filipino that is in the East Coast
I’m the rapper that you heard about
With the slurrish mouth and lyrical murder style
It’s kill or be killed, I’ll murk you clowns
Easy, bitch you ain’t versatile
I speak too many motherfucking words to count
I’ll turn your verses down 'cause you can’t work the crowds
You ain’t got the same fire, bitch you’re burning out
I’m taking everything, so put out your purses now
Uh, fuck ‘em hoes
That didn’t think I can give another go
If you can’t handle the heat, you’re a fucking joke
'Cause I will reduce you to a puff of smoke
To the trash interviewers asking how I do this
I just be myself, fucking wild ‘n stupid
They finna call 911 for a battery charge
'Cause I’m the one that put the motherfucking power to it
Don’t care ‘bout what you’re doing, I’m feeling like a boss
Can’t stop the way I’m moving, I got the want for more
I put the flavor to it, 'cause bitch I got the sauce
I’m hotter but cooler, popular loser, that’s how shit go dawg
Don’t care ‘bout what you’re doing, I’m feeling like a boss
Can’t stop the way I’m moving, I got the want for more
I put the flavor to it, 'cause bitch I got the sauce
I’m hotter but cooler, popular loser, that’s how shit go dawg
G-therz, G-therz, G-therz, G-therz
G-therz, G-therz, G-therz, G-therz

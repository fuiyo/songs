Seven months, two weeks and seven days
Since I left, who's counting anyway
But for me the only thing that's changed
Is the distance between New York and L. A.

Seven months, two weeks and seven days
Since I was so easily replaced
It's so strange how I recognize her face
Tell me does she make you feel the same
Kills me to know, she's sleepin' in my place

It's midnight and I'm wasted, so wasted, I'm wasted
I can't believe I'm callin' you up again
I know I might be crazy, so crazy, I'm crazy
I can't believe I'm callin' you just to say
I'm not ok
I just called you to say
I'm not ok
I just called you to say
I'm not ok

I'm not ok

Medicate with whisky and cheap wine
But it don't stop this train wreck in my mind
My friends all say that all will heal in time
But the truth is that don't gimme peace of mind

It's midnight and I'm wasted, so wasted, I'm wasted
I can't believe I'm callin' you up again
I know I might be crazy, so crazy, I'm crazy
I can't believe I'm callin' you just to say
I'm not ok
I just called you to say
I'm not ok
I just called you to say
I'm not ok

I'm not ok
I'm not ok
I'm not ok, yeah
I just called you to say
I just called you to say
I'm not ok

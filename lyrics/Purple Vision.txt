No I do not do the same things
I'm working hard, Yes I work for that green
I hit your bow and then I flex, so you look at me
Should've got up on your job instead of thinking 'bout that dream

Okay
My eyes red need some visine
Pourin' up that codeine
See them visions, likely
I'm sure that the demons cannot phase me
Okay
I'm animated
Feel like that lately
I've been contemplating
I've been poppin' pillies
That shit got me thinking
And she got me waking up

No I do not do the same things
I'm working hard, Yes I work for that green
I hit your bow and then I flex, so you look at me
Should've got up on your job instead of thinking 'bout that dream

Every-time I say this is my last trip
Imma take one more for the last trip
Imma get so high
So fried
I know you don't like me for my personality
I'm gon' curse you baby you don't know what I mean
She gon' go back crying, she don't know what I see
I'm gon' feel so sorry and then take one more for me

Wake up, Rohit
Set pace
Set pace
Rohit, get paid
Rohit, get paid
Set pace
Set pace
Tryna just wake up
Wake up

No I do not do the same things
I'm working hard, Yes I work for that green
I hit your bow and then I flex, so you look at me
Should've got up on your job instead of thinking 'bout that dream

Okay

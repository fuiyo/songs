Do you know what it means to be in the South side?
We done already been to the west coast
I took y'all to the boot, Louisiana
But let me ask y'all again do you really know what means to be in the South side?
Where we keep it trill, double cup so the drank don't spill, and it's nothing less than real
Thought not, so keep ya lips closed and ears open mother-

Yeah, yeah, unh
Trunks pop tops drop we boutta floss up the block
Straight to the point the light green, but I think it's bout time that I handle the rock
Y'all be so quick to want beef
But get screwed by the portions slow down and make sure that it's chopped
Bit off more than you could chew
And got put in yo place now you on the inside lookin out
RIP Screw in the skies got my eyes on the prize like his face on his shops
A.K.A. got my sights on the top
Why would I worry bout second
I lose too, but I take those Ls as lessons, so please do not get the wrong message
I know well I see the Carter's' success from a mile away
Like Victoria's Secret Spring Catalog page 27
Getting drastic with these measures
Live with the fever like Megan, that's fine because everything bigger in Texas

Purple vision means we slow it down but no time to relax
Outsiders will say we fallin' back but they just move too fast
They just here to get it done, but where do they go after that
Patience put my city on the map for them to circle back
Got my emotions poured up inside of these styrofoam cups
They just throwing subs we pack em up and throw em in our trunks
Worry bout ya'll hoods our engines running and we swangin' good
Candy paint with grains in wood, doin our thang, as we should

Im'ma get mine yeah that's part of my craft like my first name was Steve I got jobs on demand
I'm steady driven I ain't playing fair got these bows out so long I could poke at a bear
I don't show my ass like my trunk in air shining life is a dog that got nails and new hair
'Cause we got it embedded ain't no need to share
Because matter fact who said something 'bout playing fair
I ain't playing at all, yeah you know imma ball
Like my first name was John jot my goals on my walls
And coming out strong like a ghost in the fall
To look back at these walls like I been through it all
Yeah, the day that these numbers unsaved see I took off my cape
I can't always play hero gotta play it safe because we are all human I thought you'd relate
I gave my phone a break had the mop up the slate, and I shine off the line of who real and who fake
Feed em new dust when I'm doing my race let em clean it til they see the state on my plate

Purple vision means we slow it down but no time to relax
Outsiders will say we fallin' back but they just move too fast
They just here to get it done, but where do they go after that
Patience put my city on the map for them to circle back
Got my emotions poured up inside of these styrofoam cups
They just throwing subs we pack em up and throw em in our trunks
Worry bout ya'll hoods our engines running and we swangin' good
Candy paint with grains in wood, doin our thang, as we should

Yeah, yeah, unh
Trunks pop tops drop we boutta floss up the block
Trunks pop tops drop we boutta floss up the block
Trunks pop tops drop we boutta floss up the block
Straight to the point the light green, but I think it's bout time that I handle the rock
Y'all be so quick to want beef
But get screwed by the screwed by the down and make chopped chopped
Bit off more than you could chew
And got put in yo place now you on the inside lookin out
RIP Screw in the skies got my eyes on the prize like his face on his shops
A.K.A. got my sights on the top
Why would I why would I second
I lose too, but I take those Ls as lessons, so please do not get the wrong message
I know well I see the Carter's' success from a mile away
Like Victoria's Secret Spring Catalog page 27
Getting drastic with these measures
Live with the fever like Megan, that's fine because everything bigger in Texas

Purple vision means we slow it down but no time to re- to re-
Outsiders will say we falling back but they just move too fast
They just here to get it get it, but where do they go after that
Patience put my city on the map for them to circle back
Got my emotions poured up inside of these sty- cups cups
They just throwing subs we pack em up and throw em in our trunks
Worry bout ya'll hoods our hoods our running and we swanging good
Candy paint with grains in wood, doin our thing, as we should

Imma get mine yeah that's part of my craft like my first name was Steve I got jobs on de- Imma get
Imma get mine yeah that's part of my craft like my first name was Steve I got jobs on de- Imma get
Imma get mine yeah that's part of my craft like my first name was Steve I got jobs on demand
I'm steady driven I ain't playing fair got these bows out so long I could poke at a bear
I don't show my ass like my trunk in air shining life is a dog that got nails and new hair
'Cause we got it we got it ain't no need to share
Because matter fact who said something 'bout playing fair
I ain't playing you know I'm- you know Imma ball
Like my first name was John jot my goals on my walls
And coming out strong like a ghost in the fall
To look back at these walls like I been through it all
Yeah, the day that these numbers unsaved see I took off my cape
I can't always play hero gotta play it safe because we are all human I thought you'd relate
I gave my phone a break had the mop up the slate, and I shine off the line of who real and who fake
Feed em new dust when I'm doing my race let em clean it til they see the they see the plate

Purple vision means we slow it down but no time to re- to re-
Outsiders will say we falling back but they just move too fast
They just here to get it get it, but where do they go after that
Patience put my city on the map for them to circle back
Got my emotions poured up inside of these sty- cups cups
They just throwing subs we pack em up and throw em in our trunks
Worry bout ya'll hoods our hoods our running and we swanging good
Candy paint with grains in wood, doin our thang, as we should

(Purple vision means we slow it down but no time to relax)
(Outsiders will say we falling back but they just move too fast)
(They just here to get it done, but where do they go after that)
(Patience put my city on the map for them to circle back)
(Got my emotions poured up inside of these styrofoam cups)
(They just throwing subs we pack em up and throw em in our trunks)
(Worry bout ya'll hoods our engines running and we swanging good)

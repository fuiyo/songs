When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep 
Dreamed of para-para-paradise 
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach 
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly 
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly

Dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)

She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)

Sing, la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the sun must set to rise"

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh, oh

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise

This could be para-para-paradise
(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)

This could be para, be paradise
Para-paradise
Para-paradise

(Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)

This could be para, be paradise
Para-paradise
Para-paradise

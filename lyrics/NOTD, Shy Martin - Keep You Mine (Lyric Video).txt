Yeah, yeah, uh!
Yeah, yeah, uh!
Meth, check the verse, no curses, yo!
Listen! still living by the code,
Too many pretty women still living by the yo,
Yeah, yeah, uh!
Yeah, yeah, uh!
Meth, check the verse, no curses, yo, check the joint!
I'm just trying to get a meal,
When I started rhyming I wasn't trying to get a deal,
I was trying to get a feel, homicide,.. bodies lining in the hill,
... work me down in the field, especially when I'm trying to pay the bills.
A lot will be lining on the field, and see the...
You all know, nothing you better know is real,
If you work like a work shop, better know the drill!
I'm passed out these games,
You all just trying to get me out of my games
And call my black women out of their names.
I'm serious... my brain, understand my slains,
Fast and furious they're out of my lane,
Boy I'm hot, kids be calling me blaze,
In the industry I'm not, baby call me slave!
I ain't trying to burn the spot,. but I'm setting my wave,
Just a protocol of the block and the city I'm raised.
Aha! I'm still living by the code,
Too many pretty women still living by the...
Early in the morning cops kicking in the door,
Man, I think somebody is snitching on the low.
I call my father sniffing on that snow,
That's when he tried to tell me things are different than before.
Kids won't listen anymore, that's for sure!
We used to ask permission for my phone,
And no food up in the kitchen, cause we're broke
And now you're trying to miss another meal,
Cause love will get you killed and if it don't you, baby, mother will!
... recognizing daddy's real... went to that undercover pull the shield
And now is kinda... the kind of deal,
So I don't gotta tell you how I feel,
I'm trying to keep my pockets suck with hundred dollar bills.
I should have went to school and got a skill,
But it wasn't in my future so I still,
That's why I've got this rubric in your grill!

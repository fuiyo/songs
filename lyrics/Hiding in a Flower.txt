I’ve got this big ol' box with all of these flowers
Aren’t they pretty
I’m walking for hours feeling witty
So I stumble upon you not having a good day
So I say, hey hey, just take one of my flowers
And you say thanks
And it brightens up your day and you head on your way
Now I have one less flower but that’s okay because I say that I’ll be okay
Just 7 pretty flowers all wrapped in a box
I wish they were limitless but they’re not
She sits in the corner crying and I wipe her tears with a large sunflower and
She takes it and gets filled with joy
And I sink a little bit deeper
But that’s fine
Because I’ve still got some flowers left
I think some of them I should’ve kept
But it’s too late now, because I’m helping other people
So that makes it ok it’s not too late
Another day another flower
Are you okay another flower
Out of harms way
Another day another flower
3, 2, 1 flowers left and I’m running oh so low, so low on life that I once had
I take a glance at my friend in the garden
And they need a flower
So I debate to give my flower to give them the power of joy in their life
And fight away any sour thoughts that they have every single day
And take it on myself as I drift far away
Deeper into the dirt I crawl like my flowers
Cause I’m all out and I’m all out of sun
I wish I never had any flowers
Because now like a vase I’m empty
But at least everyone else has my flowers and that makes them happy
So maybe it’s worth it in the end a hand I could lend
Yet I’m losing grasp on my own sense of life
But then I see her from across the room
She grips a bouquet of flowers and so brightly they bloom
Behind me the darkness looms so soon a tomb
But I take a step towards her
And her smile is like the water to my non existence flowers
She hands me a rose and her soft skin is like the sun
It nourishes the dark that I’ve been hiding in for so long
I have a flower once again, and happiness is where I seek
And maybe, just maybe, a whole garden I’ll keep
So always hold onto your flowers
For when the days get sour

Is it my fault if I'm not good at expressing?
I'm a warm girl in a cold city
Can't I just tell you I like you?
I just want to be honest

Go away, no don't go away
Show me your heart, no don't show it to me
All day, only your smile is in my head
Do you wanna just go out?
Starting from today, I'm gonna have something with you
I'm gonna call you every day
Even though I can't eat gluten
I'm gonna go around eating delicious food with you

So, so sweet, you're really so sweet
So, so sweet, you are

Can't I just tell you I like you?
I just want to be honest

Go away, no don't go away
Show me your heart, no don't show it to me
All day, only your smile is in my head
Do you wanna just go out?

Starting from today, I'm gonna have something with you
I'm gonna call you every day
Even though I can't eat gluten
I'm gonna go around eating delicious food with you

Isn't this how love starts?
Maybe it's like hanging half my heart on you
Even though it feels like you'll reject me
I'm gonna give it a try once more

Starting from today, I'm gonna have something with you
I'm gonna call you every day
Even though I can't eat spicy food
I'm gonna go around eating delicious food with you
Press "like" on my photos like you do for her
Let me talk to you too
I feel so down so I'm giving up today
Just when I'm about to look back, you hold onto me

So, so sweet, you're really so sweet
So, so sweet, you are

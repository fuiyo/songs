Well it's been so long
I swore I'd never come back
To this sleepy little one horse dot on the map
But the roots run deep
In this rocky red ground
And I could feel that pull, every road I went down

Growing up around here in this taillight town
I spent seventeen years tryin' to find a way out
Took a whole lot of miles to know what I know now
I'm kind of proud of growing up around here
Well I kissed my first girl
Behind that Texaco sign
I drank my first cold beer by that river side
I played a little football
Got a letter on my jacket
I bet it's still in that box, up there in my Mom's attic

Growing up around here in this taillight town
I spent seventeen years tryin' to find a way out
Took a whole lot of miles to know what I know now
I'm kind of proud of growing up around here

Yeah I know someday
No matter how far I roam
Oh I'll end up back this way
And I'll call this place home
Yeah there's no place like home

Growing up around here in this taillight town
I spent seventeen years tryin' to find a way out
Took a whole lot of miles to know what I know now
Growing up around here in this taillight town
I spent seventeen years tryin' to find a way out
Took a whole lot of miles to know what I know now
I'm kind of proud of growing up around here
Yeah I'm proud
Of growing up around here

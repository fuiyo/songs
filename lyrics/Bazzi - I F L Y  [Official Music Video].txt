And uh, I thought I was gonna go mad
But after a few months I had pu-begun to pull myself together
When this house just, turned into a living nightmare
A living nightmare? What was it that caused Binder, a perfectly sane man, to hear chilling sounds that walked through his house
Or suddenly view an apparition in human form
These incidents brought me to the next step in verifying this mans testimony
Please survive, please strive
With binders approval, I brought in specialists
Two men trained in the field of supеrnatural phenomenon
Utilizing the most sophisticatеd equipment available

Let me breathe I feel that I'm chokin' off my welfare
My physical's here, my mindstate's over there
Every day I scheme over tickets and busfare
Daily shit that make Stocktown illegit
Night comes every Saturday around ten
That's when the  for hip hop really begins
Step to the S-T-U-R-E
But sucker guards at the door got no love for my company
Fuck 'em, I'm a star I should be V-I-P
Then ask for ID stress me for some entry
What's up, black man got no life in Stocktown?
(You down) Show your true colors when I'm not around
Escape, it's all about escapism (Where ya at?)
Locked in jail and we call it capitalism
Almost twentythree stuck in S-W-E
Help me set it off so my mind can be free

See conditions that they are creating
Making believe that we are still waiting
For their permission to make conditions
But we'll survive, we'll strive
This is a vibe in all their society
Even if it's a lie it's their reality
And until the change all feel the pain
Of the madness in their community

A Stocktown state of mind is what I find myself in
And that's the way I be until when (When?)
Twenty years from now the lights still shinin' (Uh)
As long as there's a top brothers don't stop
We keep climbin' (We're gonna keep climbin')
We keep climbin' We keep climbin' (We'll survive, we'll strive)
Climbin', we keep climbin', we keep climbin' (Gotta keep climbin')
(But we'll survive)

Another Stocktown nigga dwellin' allover the place
Son I'll make another hit and then I'm ghost like face
To the next stop, don't make me vex hops, 'cause I'm ill
Just got out of jail and I'm out to make a mil'
In the streets of depression, no question
And less than a few kid I show you how I do
Comin' through T-Central, my mental be far from gentle
Stocktown state of mind when I enter the center
Now I make like a pro, and 'ceed to the central ave
Go to Royal Viking for a bubble bath
Chillin' in the 'cuzi with mo Cisco than San Fran
I even make that alcoholic crew say damn
Start wilin' on the block, bow down when I'm illin'
Civilized people try to sue like I was sellin'
But I'm not, they just want to see a nigga drop
F that, I'm headin' straight for the fuckin' top

Ideas propagated by schism's
Love for humanity no humanism
A game, a play that'll end some day
But we can't let it take us away
They play my music they dance my dance
But from me they take a distance
This is not short of insanity
And in Stocktown it's reality

A Stocktown state of mind is what I find myself in
And that's the way I be until when (When?)
Twenty years from now the lights still shinin' (Uh)
As long as there's a top (We've got to keep climbin') brothers don't stop
We keep climbin', we keep climbin'
We keep climbin' (We'll survive, we'll strive)
Climbin', (Gotta keep climbin') We keep climbin', we keep climbin' (We will survive)

We climb to the max until we reach the climax
N-E-O and A-D-L on the mic, drop a fact
Yeah, we set it off when we ready (Ready)
Then we go to blue vision to check the new rockets are ready
So stop frontin' kid you know you've been there
'Cause you took the blue line to the peace-home-square(Mhm)
Yeah Saint Eriks got a nigga goin' tropical
That's how we get down in the mothafuckin' capitol
We take the Five-Ninety-Five, four o' clock in the mornin'
Still knockin' brothas out the ring like Forman (Blaow)
Performin' in Kungsträdgården, on the regular
On Government street I be the ill dispute settler
----- like the store downtown
Saturdays when puff fails do the swing-a-ling sound
So in 1996 we remain in the mix
So here's a middlefinger for all y'all B-S cliques

We gotta keep climbin', We'll survive, we'll strive
We've got to keep on climbin' (We keep climbin')
And we will survive

This here is Light Skinny representin' in the mix you know'im sayin?
Once again with the shout outs, word up (Buck)
I wanna say what up to my nigga Chimney Head
Slim my potna in rhyme you know what I'm sayin'
Bazz  and Dre, D-sharp the whole clique you know I'm sayin'?
Thug Love, my brother Sha and blaze bla
The list goes on and on
Yeah yeah yeah yo this ya nigga ADL, you know i'm sayin'?
I'd like to say what's up  and the force
Skully dead  King Floyd, Big Ben and John
 Leafnuts, Daddy Boastin, One Eye Red
You know what we said? That's the life in Stocktown
Peace
Keep climbin'
Keep climbin'
We got to keep on climbin'
Gotta keep climbin'

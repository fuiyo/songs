Call you one time, two time, three time, I can't wait no more
Your fingers through my hair, that's on my mind
I know it's been a minute since you walked right through that door
But I still think about you all the time

I don't know, I don't know how I'm gonna blank it out
I don't know, I don't know how you got me sayin'

I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely as
Come hold me, come hold me, come hold me
It's been me, myself and why did you go, did you go? Oh
I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, lonely, I

Yeah I still watch the shows you showed me, I still drink that wine
But these days it tastes more bitter than sweet (Hmm)
And all my friends are way too drunk to save me from my phone
So sorry if I say some things I mean

I don't know, I don't know how I'm gonna make it out
I don't know, I don't know how you got me sayin'

I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely as
Come hold me, come hold me, come hold me
It's been me, myself and why did you go, did you go? Oh
I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, lonely, I

Miss those nights when you would come over
Spent all night just tryin' to get closer
That was June and now it's October
I don't want, don't want to get over

Miss those nights when you would come over
Spent all night just tryin' to get closer
That was June and now it's October
I don't want, don't want to get over you

Hmmm (Hmmm, hmmm)
Get over you
(Hmmm, hmmm)

I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely as
Come hold me, come hold me, come hold me
It's been me, myself and why did you go, did you go? Oh
I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm lonely, lonely, I

Miss those nights when you would come over
Spent all night just tryin' to get closer
That was June and now it's October
I don't want, don't want to get over you

Miss those nights when you would come over
Spent all night just tryin' to get closer
That was June and now it's October
I don't want, don't want to get over you

Hmm, hmmm

No gods, no kings only man

They are not one of us
They are not one of us
They are not one of us
They are not one of us

Disconnected and unwanted
Distressed and cut off
Hope and despair silencing the world

No gods, no kings only man
No gods, no kings only man

They are not one of us
They are not one of us
They are not one of us
They are not one of us

The future is black and gray
There is no tomorrow
Torn apart by weakness
A cancer on the earth

No gods, no kings only man
No gods, no kings only man
No gods, no kings only man
No gods, no kings only man

No gods, no kings only man
No gods, no kings only man
No gods, no kings only man
No gods, no kings only man

The spirit lies contaminated
The fall of seduction
Transformation of yourself

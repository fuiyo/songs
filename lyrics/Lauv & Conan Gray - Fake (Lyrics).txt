Yeah

You and your friends you live on the surface
Act like you're perfect, everyone knows
You're just like everyone else
Except for you're better at takin' photos
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Why you gotta make everything a show?

Man, you're so fucking fake, ah-ah
You don't mean a single thing you say, ah-ah
If we got a problem, say it to my face, ah-ah
And you're just like all the people that you hate (you're so fake)
When the real you's back, I'll pick up my phone

Callin' me up when you're gettin' drunk
You say you're in love, but what do you mean?
'Cause when you wake up, you blame it on drugs
And then we break up, you lie through your teeth
You just wanna play little games for attention
(You just wanna play little games for attention)
Tellin' me your perfect lies and wastin' all my time

'Cause, you're so fucking fake, ah-ah
You don't mean a single thing you say, ah-ah
If we've got a problem, say it to my face, ah-ah
And you're just like all the people that you hate (you're so fake)
When the real you's back, I'll pick up my phone

You just want to play little games for attention
(You just want to play little games for attention)
Pushin' me away so I crave your affection
(Pushin' me away so I crave your affection)
Callin' me insane, but you stay in my mentions
(Callin' me insane, but you stay in my mentions)
Tellin' me your perfect lies and wastin' all my time

'Cause, you're so fucking fake, ah-ah
You don't mean a single thing you say, ah-ah (oh)
If we've got a problem, say it to my face, ah-ah (oh)
And you're just like all the people that you hate (you're so fake, woo)
When the real you's back, I'll pick up my phone

Pedigree better than a falcon
Peregrine, had to block the drunk calls I get from Dave Letterman
Stealing bath robes from the Sheraton Hotel
Head of the Paladin, riding on my coattails
It's low but you hear the bass from the basement
Come in Levi's, so high, wasted
Five blocks away hear the speaker box jinglin'
A rin tin tin got my Spidey senses tinglin' (my rin tin tin)
Now now full of them burger rings for a canape
Blue blood, Prince of Persia, the presidential candidate
Feet work like a centipede
Spread the seed, caraway
Kerouac, On the Road, red light green, ready go
You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me
You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me

You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me
You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me

Well this is for my ladies, from Rose Bay (girl)
Fish the big dog, why you in the foyer? (girl)
I'll be using all the cable, I be using all your pay per
All my friends are DJs, all my (all my) friends got great pay
Get wild, get famous, get wet, entertain us
Hard life my cycle frame is steel, yeah, you know itâ€™s stainless
Circus boy, tiger tamers
Smooth skin, reputation
Supermarket bound to shame us
Breaking hearts, breaking stages

You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me
You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me

You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me
You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me

Let your mind write checks
Your body don't have the cash for
Live your life VHS, cassette, fast forward
Back to the future, find my raps in the app store
Fell down the rabbit hole, Wonderland, passport
Climbing back up through the cracks in the asphalt
Walking Dead done throw, mouth's full of bath salt
We party like Wall Street, never gonna crash though
Get ready, this is what you wave your stacks around for

You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me
You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me
You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me
You just weren't, you just weren't
You just weren't ready for me

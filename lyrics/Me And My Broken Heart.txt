We were waiting at the church we watched and saw the weddin' start
As the organ played we stood there and prayed just me and my broken heart
So can't you see that you have done to me oh foolish foolish pride
You brought tears and sorrow too an untrue heart that never cried
[ steel ]
I saw the sunshine of my life who once I know just worshipped me
Standing by another's side and soon his bride she'll be
I bowed my head in grief and shame as I felt the teardrops start
But as the organ played we stood there and prayed just me and my broken heart

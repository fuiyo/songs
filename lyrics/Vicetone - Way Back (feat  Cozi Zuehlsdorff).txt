Playing with temptation, searching for salvation
Can we find our way back, way back?
Caught up in confusion, need a resolution
Can we find our way back, way back?

No more running, no more running, no more chasing
No more running, now I'm running out of patience
Caught up in confusion, need a resolution
Can we find our way back, way back?

Hey

Can we find our way back?
Way back, back, back (hey)

Can we find our way back?
Way back, back

Playing with temptation, searching for salvation
Can we find our way back, way back?
Caught up in confusion, need a resolution
Can we find our way back, way back?

No more running, no more running, no more chasing
No more running, now I'm running out of patience
Caught up in confusion, need a resolution
Can we find our way back?
Way back, back, back (hey)

Can we find our way back?
Way back, back, back

No more running, no more running, no more chasing
No more running, now I'm running out of patience
Caught up in confusion, need a resolution
Can we find our way back?
Way back, back, back (hey)

Can we find our way back?
Way back, back, back (hey)

Can we find our way back?

Some guy skipped in front of me
Can't believe I paid an entry fee
And I don't even got the energy
To smile for a selfie
And I know that I should go home
But I'm still standing here so
I guess one more for the road
I wanna raise a toast so

This one's for the sparklers
Dudes wearing shades in the darkness
But hats off to the DJ
Same song twice in an evening (1, 2,3)

Oh, save me (Save me), can't take it (Take it)
I don't belong in this club
One dance (One dance), no chance (No chance)
'Cause I'm feeling awkward as (Oh)
I was waiting in line for an hour
Just to get in now, I wanna get out 'cause (Oh)
I'm jaded (I'm jaded), can't fake it (Can't fake it)
I don't belong in this club, no

Hopped out of the Uber (Uber)
I was feeling myself (Goddamn)
Had the polo with the bolo (I did)
With some eel on the belt (Hoo)
Walked up to the bouncer (Hey, what's up man?)
Whole squad on stealth (I'm Macklemore)
He said, "Mackler, who?" (It's me)
You gotta wait like everybody else
Shoulda stayed on the sofa
Forgot I hate being social
And I miss my ex-girl
This Drake song making me 'motional (Girl, you hurt my feelings)
I'm feeling awkward as hell (Uh-huh)
I only came here to dance (Wassup?)
The DJ ain't playing the cuts (No)
And what do I do with my hands? (It's awkward)
Roll with the punches and hold my Red Bull up
And I toast the nights like this that I probably won't remember much
'Bout to pull that Irish goodbye, grab my stuff, 'bout to cut
And the DJ yells, "Macklemore in the house tonight"
Ah, fuck

Oh, save me (Save me), can't take it (Take it)
I don't belong in this club (Club)
One dance (One dance), no chance (No chance)
'Cause I'm feeling awkward as (Oh)
I was waiting in line for an hour
Just to get in now, I wanna get out 'cause (Oh)
I'm jaded (I'm jaded), can't fake it (Can't fake it)
I don't belong in this club

And to think that I've waited all week (No)
To get someone's drink spilled over me (I)
I don't care if the Uber's on surge (No I don't, no)
I'd do anything to get out of this club

Save me, can't take it, no
I don't belong in this club
One dance, no chance
'Cause I'm feeling awkward as (Oh)
I was waiting in line for an hour
Just to get in now, I wanna get out 'cause (Oh)
I'm jaded (I'm jaded), can't fake it (Can't fake it)
I don't belong in this club

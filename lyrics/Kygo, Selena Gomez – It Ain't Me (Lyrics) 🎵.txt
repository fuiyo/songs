I had a dream we were sippin' whiskey neat
Highest floor, The Bowery, nowhere's high enough
Somewhere along the lines we stopped seein' eye to eye
You were stayin' out all night and I had enough

No, I don't wanna know where you been or where you're goin'
But I know I won't be home, and you'll be on your own

Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's wakin' up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?

It ain't me (The Bowery)
(Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
It ain't me (The Bowery)
(Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)

It ain't me (The Bowery)
(Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
It ain't me (The Bowery)
(Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
It ain't me

I had a dream, we were back to 17
Summer nights and The Libertines, never growin' up
I'll take with me the Polaroids and the memories
But you know I'm gonna leave behind the worst of us

Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep?
Who's wakin' up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone?
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?

It ain't me, no, no
It ain't me, no, no
It ain't me, no, no
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the mornin'?

It ain't me (The Bowery)
(Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
It ain't me (The Bowery)
It ain't me (grateful, I'm so grateful, I)

Ah, ooh (The Bowery)
Ah, ooh (whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
Ah, ooh (it ain't me, The Bowery)
Ah, oh (whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)

It ain't me (The Bowery)
(Whiskey neat, grateful, I'm so grateful, I)
It ain't me, na, na, na, na-na, The Bowery
Na, na, na, na-na, whiskey neat (grateful, I'm so grateful, I)

It ain't me

Then I woke up in love (woke up in love)
Then I woke up in love

Lately I've been losing these nights 
One more heartbreak and I'm done with this
Shadows on the ceiling, they don't fight
But I still argue for the hell of it

I'm trying my hardest now, I feel you reaching out
I don't wanna be the one that's always on the edge

You found me all messed up
You found down on my luck, so lost
But then I woke up in love
When I was chasing highs
You went and saved my life
You picked me up
Thank God I woke up in love

With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love

Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love

Sometimes all those dark days, but they try to find me
But that's when I lean on you
Whatever happens, my troubles behind me 
'Cause your love's gonna see me through

Nothing can bring me down, I feel you reaching out
You're pulling me back when I'm about to reach the edge

You found me all messed up
You found me down on my luck, so lost
But then I woke up in love
When I was chasing highs
You went and saved my life
You picked me up
Thank God I woke up in love

With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love
With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love

Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love
Then I woke up in love

You found me all messed up (all messed up)
You found me down on my luck, so lost
But then I woke up in love (then I woke up in love)
When I was chasing highs
You went and saved my life
You picked me up
Thank God I woke up in love (woke up in love)

With you
Thought I was lost, but then I woke up in love (woke up in love)
With you

You're saying it's hopeless, that I should hope less
Heaven can help us, well, maybe she might
You say it's beyond us
What is beyond us? Let's see and decide

We've been meteoric even before this
Burns half as long when it's twice as bright
So if it's beyond us, then it's beyond us
Let's see and decide

And I will still be here stargazing
I'll still lookup, lookup, lookup for love
I will still be here stargazing
I'll still lookup, lookup, lookup for love

For love

For love

For love

For love

I'm trying to save us; you don't want to save us
You blame human nature, and say it's unkind
Let's make up our own minds; we've got our whole lives
Let's see and decide, decide

And I will still be here stargazing
I'll still lookup, lookup, lookup for love
Stars don't disappear; they keep blazing
Even when the night is over

And I will still be here stargazing
I'll still lookup, lookup, lookup for love
Stars don't disappear; they keep blazing
Even when the night is over

That's how I find the light
That's how I find the light
Ooh-ooh

For love

For love

That's how I find the light
That's how I find the light
Ooh-ooh

For love

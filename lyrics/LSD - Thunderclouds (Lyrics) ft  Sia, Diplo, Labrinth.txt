All I need is one
One old man is enough
Babe, you got it wrong
Please turn your fears into trust
To trust

Where'd the love go?
When all is said and done?
Hey now, I got your hands in the air
I'ma go through your stuff
Where'd the love go?
Put the running into run
You're asking me to stay
But I never met a girl I could trust

You're saying those words like you hate me now (wo-woah)
Our house is burning
When you're raising hell (wo-woah)
Here in the ashes
Your soul cries out (ah-ah-ah)
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds, oh no
These thunderclouds, oh no, no

All I need is love
(Da-dum, dum, dum)
All I need is a word
(Da-dum, dum, dum)
All I need is us
(Da-dum, dum, dum)
You turn nouns into verbs (ooh, oh)
To verbs (ooh, oh)

Where did love go?
When all is said and done?
Hey now, put your hands in the air
I'ma go through your stuff
Where did love go?
You put the running into run
You're asking me to stay
But I never met a man I could trust
Hey, yeah

You're saying those words like you hate me now (wo-woah)
Our house is burning
When you're raising hell (wo-woah)
Here in the ashes
Your soul cries out (ah-ah-ah)
But don't be afraid of these thunderclouds
These thunderclouds, oh no
These thunderclouds, oh no, no
These thunderclouds, oh no
These thunderclouds, oh no, no

These thunderclouds (oh, whoa)
These thunderclouds (ah, ah, ah)
These thunderclouds (oh, oh)

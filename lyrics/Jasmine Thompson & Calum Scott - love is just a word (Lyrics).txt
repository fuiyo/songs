Love, there's nothing more to say
Every words already been written
Every chord, already played
You, make everything make sense
Every melody, it's different
Every line and sentiment
Sounds brand new
After you

Purple Rain, is only rain without you
Yesterday is just another day
Hallelujah's an old song, by an old man in a suit
And I guess love is just a word
Without you

Trust, is something you can't fake
It's so delicate and fragile
And it's something you can't break
They call it luck, it's something you can't make
It's a falling star you catch and then you hope to God, it stays
And you caught me, and I caught you

Purple Rain, is only rain without you
Yesterday is just another day
Hallelujah's an old song, by an old man in a suit
And I guess love is just a word
Without you

I'm half the man I'm supposed to be
Only one more thing to say
I fall in love more every day
When I'm with you
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
You're everything to me
The better part of me

Purple Rain, is only rain without you
Yesterday is just another day
Hallelujah's an old song, by an old man in a suit
And I guess love is just a word
Without you

And I guess love is just a word
Without you
You, there's nothing more to say
Every word's already been written
Every chord, already played

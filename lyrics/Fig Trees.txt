Never never knew that the time would come
When every mans got to find where he does come from
Never never knew that the time would come
When every fig must find its fig tree

jump little figs into your tree
And say you are free. say you are free, say you are free
I've been rebuked and I've been scorned,
Rejected of men, now I'm born
To live a new, so won't you too,
My loved ones come drink new wine with me
Lets live and love in peace and harmony
And say we are free, say we are free, say we are free

in my fig tree, (Chorus: in my little fig tree) where I wanna be,
So safe and free, in my fig tree (Chorus:in my little fig tree),
Where I long to be from all misery

in my fig tree (Chorus: in my little fig tree) where I wanna be
So safe and free in my fig tree (Chorus: In my little fig tree)
Where I long to be from all misery, yeah yeah yeah yea

Now ever man is a man and every mickle make a mottle
Don't free some and put some in a shackle
For now is the time and the time is now
When we should live like in the days of old
When every sheep had their fold

to say they are free, (Chorus:say they are free) to say they are free
In my fig tree, (Chorus:in my little fig tree) where I wanna be,
So safe and free in my fig tree, (Chorus:in my little fig tree)
Where I long to be from all misery.
In my fig tree (Chorus:in my little fig tree)
Where I wanna be, so safe and free
In my fig tree (Chorus:in my little fig tree)
Where I long to be from all misery
In my my my my fig tree where I wanna be so safe and free
In my my my my fig tree where I long to be from all misery

Soma is what they would take when hard times opened their eyes
Saw pain in a new way, high stakes for a few names
Racing against sun beams, losing against their dreams
In your eyes

And I am stop and go
In your eyes
See I am stop and go
In your eyes

Let's go

When I saw her for the first time, lips moved as her eyes closed
Heard something in his voice
"And I'll be there", he says, then he walks out
Somehow he was trying too hard to be like them

And I am stop and go
In your eyes
And I am stop
Oh, darling, let me go

Tried it once and they liked it, then tried to hide it
Says, "I've been doing this twenty-five years"
Well I'm not listening no more
And these friends, they keep asking for more

Oh, yeah

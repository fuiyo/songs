Every time I see your face
There's a cloud hangin' over you
In such a beautiful way
There's a poetry to your solitude

Ooh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forever more
Oh, I've been thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours

Ooh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forever more
Oh, I've been thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours

Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours

Tell me I'm forever yours

You won't ever have to try
To live by everybody else's rules
It'll be just you and I
Together in the altitude

Ooh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forever more
Oh, I've been thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours

Ooh, you should let me love you
Hold me now, forever more
Oh, I've been thinking of you
Tell me I'm forever yours

Tell me I'm forever yours
Tell me I'm forever yours

Tell me I'm forever yours

You should let me love ya, love ya
You should let me love ya, love ya

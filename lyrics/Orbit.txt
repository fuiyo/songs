It's just you, it's just me
I lost you in dreams
Now I'm falling
Please don't catch, let me break
Into pieces of hate
Still I'm soaring

Kind of sad but you remind me
You remind me of a love that I once knew
Kind of sad but you remind me
You remind me of a love who outgrew me too

He released me into orbit
Still I found a way to navigate to you
He released me into orbit
Still I found a way to gravitate to you, oh

Yeah, he told me
Here we are close to midnight
But something don't feel right
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
On your rocket ship
Take care you don't slip to a new realm
I'll wait for ya by the hotel
Please pay my bills before you lose your
Head over heels
I don't care about this dog and you know I can't afford it
I don't wanna get bigger
Gravity will hold me down like a sticker, yeah
I release, I release you
I don't need, I don't need
If I lose you, I lose you
You can give me the voodoo
Like D'Angelo said, "How does it, how does it feel?"
He knew how it, how it would feel

When he released me into orbit
Still I found a way to navigate to you
He released me into orbit
Still I found a way to gravitate to you

Oh no
Please don't say you're desertin', oh
Don't leave me revolving
I'm nearly dissolving, it's true
Please don't lie like the last time
Left me barely holding on
Won't do this again
'Cause I'll spin into infinite moons

Kinda sad but you remind me
You remind me of a love that I once knew
Kinda sad but you remind me
You remind me of a love who outgrew me too

He released me into orbit
Still I found a way to gravitate to you
He released me into orbit
Still I found a way to navigate to you

I gravitate to you
I gravitate to you
I gravitate to you
I gravitate to you, oh
